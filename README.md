On weekdays there are two major spikes of time, corresponding to commutes to (6 am - 9 am)
And from (4 pm – 7pm) work. The weekends also see heavy usage from 10 am to 7 pm. From 11 pm to 5 am, there is almost no usage of Citibikes.

The trends seen above are seen in both males and females though males are more likely to use bikes later at night and have higher overall usage.

The vast majority of usage is among subscribers rather than onetime customers. 


# Summary
These results show that most of Citibike’s users are male and working. Indeed, many use the bike to commute to and from work. As such, advertising targeting men as an alternative method of commuting and exercise may be successful.  Two additional visualizations that would be helpful would be usage in colder months of the year to know if usage is seasonal and whether most subscribers were onetime users previously to know if Citibike should continue to allow onetime use.
